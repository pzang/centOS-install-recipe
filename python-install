# First get the setup script for Setuptools:
wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py

# Then install it for Python 2.7 and/or Python 3.3:
python2.7 ez_setup.py
python3.3 ez_setup.py

# Now install pip using the newly installed setuptools:
easy_install-2.7 pip
easy_install-3.3 pip

# With pip installed you can now do things like this:
pip2.7 install [packagename]
pip2.7 install --upgrade [packagename]
pip2.7 uninstall [packagename]
